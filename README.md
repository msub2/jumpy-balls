# Jumpy Balls

![screenshot](assets/favicon/screenshot.jpg)

This is a fork of the [Jumpy Balls](https://github.com/MozillaVR/jumpy-balls) project by MozillaVR, as the original is no longer maintained or updated by Mozilla and the original links to access it have expired.

This fork is intended to expand on the original Jumpy Balls to integrate more WebXR features (passthrough, hand tracking, etc) and add additional game content.
